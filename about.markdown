I who write here am Magnus Eriksson, long time internet being and currently PhD student in socioogy of law writing about the relation between law, digitalization and urban space. 

Currently I'm a PhD candidate in a joint collaboration between Lund University, Sweden and University of Macerata, Italy. My thesis is going to be a re-examination of the last decade of theories about the relation between code and law in the light of recent developments in computation.

I am also holding a research position at The Interactive Institute, which is a swedish research institute of interaction design. Currently we do reasearch projects about XXX. The research is multidisciplinary stretching from technologists to humanists. My role is often to provide critical theoretical perspectives and to conduct empirical social science research by I'm also involved in everything from programming to project management.

Despite a broad range of practices and research interests, as an academic, I feel most at home in sociology, philosophy and media studies. A common ground for all is "internet critique".

My research topics as a student were spanning file-sharing, the hackerspace movement, the use of military technology in the history of electronic music and various more theoretical topics in poststructuralist theory, philosophy and critical internet studies. Most of these have left some trace on this blog.

Outside of academic research, I've been involved in several projects spanning the spectrum from activism to art in the last decade starting with co-founding Piratbyrån in 2003. Other internet projects are too numerous to mention but a few I've been involved in is The Julia Group and Telecomix and the art group FATLAB. I've also been involved in the hackerspace movement in Malmö, Stockholm and (currently) Gothenburg.
