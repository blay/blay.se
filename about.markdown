I who write here am Magnus Eriksson, long time internet being and currently PhD student in sociology of law writing about the relation between law, digitalization and urban space. 

My PhD is a joint collaboration between Lund University, Sweden and University of Macerata, Italy. My thesis is on the role of software in the regulation of urban space. It is an attempt to think digital technologies as material and spatial phenomena in order to better grasp the agency and normativity of emerging technologies that mediate between code and urban environments. I am especially interested in how urban space and physical activities are regulated and structured to ensure the functioning, capture and compliance with software systems.

I am also holding a research position at The Interactive Institute, which is a swedish research institute of interaction design. The research is multidisciplinary stretching from technologists to humanists. My role is often to provide critical theoretical perspectives and to conduct empirical social science research by I'm also involved in everything from programming to project management.

Despite a broad range of practices and research interests, as an academic, I feel most at home in sociology, philosophy and media studies.

My research topics as a student were spanning file-sharing, the hackerspace movement, the use of military technology in the history of electronic music and various more theoretical topics in poststructuralist theory, philosophy and critical internet studies. Most of these have left some trace on this blog.

Outside of academic research, I've been involved in several projects spanning the spectrum from activism to art in the last decade starting with co-founding Piratbyrån in 2003. Other internet projects are too numerous to mention but a few I've been involved in is The Julia Group and Telecomix and the art group FATLAB. I've also been involved in the hackerspace movement in Malmö, Stockholm and (currently) Gothenburg.
