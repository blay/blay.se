<p style="clear: both">I tagged all my post written in English (at least the ones containing the word "that" which is what I searched for) <a href="http://www.blay.se/tag/english/">HERE</a>.<br /><br />I don't write that much in English and it's mostly write-ups on talks I have done. If readers (you poor Google Translate readers) bug me about it I will start to write more in English</p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both" />
