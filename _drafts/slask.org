# A hackathon for everyone
Where technologists are coupled with other stakeholders; citizens, residents, activists, companies, crafters and so on

A hackathon that builds community, that is the start of something, and builds lasting partnerships.

Organized as different weekends on different topics. Invite hackers and someone who is a stakeholder in this specific problem.

It should be diverse, inclusive and most importantly -... fun. 

Hackers of all types should come because it gives them inspiration and input. People should come because it gives them new ideas, opportunities. 

It should combine thinking, doing and learning in a new way.

Hackers + people with insights, knowledge and experience of the topics.

As part of the experience we should also conduct studies and interviews to learn more about the process and how to make it work.
