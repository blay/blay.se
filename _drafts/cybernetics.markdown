- Borges talks about he emperor who wanted such an exact map of the empire that the monarch's subjects spent as much time and energy detailing the map and maintaining it theat the empire "itself" fell into ruins the more the map was perfected. Such is the madness of an empire where something only "is" if it is represented.
- "The new conquerors, who we'll call the cyberneticians, do not compromise an organized party [...] but rather a diffuse constellation of agents."
- Cybernetics is not a separate sphere of the production of information and communication. It is an autonomous abstract machine that has made itself into a global, distributed war machine.
- The cybernetic hypothesis warns against a new, federated, type of governance. It does not need individuals (as the liberal hypothesis does) but only identifiers. 
- The liberal hypothesis dies in WWI. Cybernetics came as an answer to the crisis of the world wars. 
- Cybernetics restores the social totality through distributed flows, not static identity. Power operates not by the sovereign, but the coordination of flows of information using distributed capturers, information handlers and proximities. 
- Cybernetics negates everything that escapes regulation. All the escape routes that might have existed amidst norms and apparatuses of the discipline society. 
- Cybernetics test itself and confronts being in a self-reinforcing process.
- Cybernetics is an ensamble of autonomous devices.
- Cybernetics greek origin is that of "piloting". Piloting others (governance), onself, and ones body (medicine). For the greeks, this piloting was a "tekhne". We thus have an "art of cybernetics".
- Cybernetics is the politics at the end of politics. Policing is not only enforcment, but a way of thinking.
- Cybernetics is a war against all that lives and all that is lasting.
- Cybernetics turn reality into an information problem. It sees a gap between existing and desired behaviour and uses information feedback and probing to bridge that gap. The gap is bridged when an optimum degree of communication is established between the different parts of the system.
- Cybernetics as an information system relies of two things:
 1. Representation separating beings
 2. Communication connecting beings
 - This is summed up by the phrase "do not lick the robot"
- Cybernetics justifies two experiments:
 1. Turning living beings into machines (integrated into systems)
 2. Imitate the living with macines (networks fascilitating universal communication) 
- Cybernetics is universal enrollment by mimicking life through oversimplification of communication.
- The logical crisis of mathematics brought about by Gödel and Heiselberg testified to an unavoidable imperfection of all human creation. The rise of the applied mathematics of cybernetics corresponds to the necessity for power to "pilot" imcomplete, complex and non-foundational systems.
- Cybernetics integrates everything using a universal template. TCP/IP, HTTP, RSS, Twitter. Web2.0 is the universal templating of the internet. 
- We must understand that communication is only important due to our prior separation by representation (relations mediated by institutions). Cybernetic communication is not an end in itself. At some point we must become anti-cybernetics and go beyond communication, to meet and conspire (in its true sense; to breath together).
- Cybernetics create a *total templating*. A plane on which the entire complex social dynamics are played out.
- Cybernetics tries to link energy systems and information systems through similarities in entropic effects of time on the respective systems.
- It is the ultimate mission of cybernetics to fight general enthopy threatening living beings, machines and societies --- without residing to static structures. Instead they call for a permanent revitalization endlessly restoring the integrity of the whole.
- In cybernetics, mankind appears as a necessary factor of disturbance. /Heidegger
- Cybernetics wants to leave macro-institutions such as state and market and prefer devices. It is easier to manage cybernetic systems on a small scale (relative to the control organ), which is why cybernetics prefer distributed and federated control.
- Cybernetics dows not rely on the individual but on socio-cybernetic feedback as the basic unit. The liberal hypothesis established the individual with her rights --- cybernetics reconstructs social bonds. The premise for this reconstruction is that bodies and emotions are abstracted within a system of symbols. Cybernetics thus both dehumanizes bodies and rehumanizes them as abstract properties.
- "It is the ultimate goal of mental health to help people to live with their peers *in the same world*". In other words, the goal is to integrate people in the dynamism of the cybernetic totality.
- Norbert Wiener did not believe in the liberal hypothesis. The individual information was distorted by advertising and media concentration and the state contained less information than civil society.
- Like any discourse based directly on Newton physics, classical economics began to give out. The cybernetics-influenced response from economics - favouring the balancing of systems over utilitarian individual choices - was neo-liberalism. In cybernetic neo-liberalism, the allocation is not about wealth but information. For the cybernetics of neo-liberalism, all problems present themselves as information problems. Capitalism in this form thus presents itself as the best possible means of social self-regulation. 
- Cybernetics is the tool by which capitalism unifies its capacity for disintegration and its quest for structuring entities to capture profit. Cybernetics is the tool that regulates what disintegrates and what is structured.
- The second age of the technological machine was motorized machines with a one-way subjectification --- constructor => machine => operator. The third wave is cybernetic machinery coupling man/machine in a process of internal, mutual communication. It is no longer the question of a "user".
- The first control-problem took place with the first collision of trains. Synchronised clocks, the telegraph and assembly line production was invented in this period. Cybernetics becomes the visible hand of the market. This further leads to a period of predictability with fordism on the production side and advertising on the consumption side. Cybernetics entered into the operation of capitalism with the intention of minimising uncertainties, incommensurability and the kinds of anticipation problems that can interfere in any commodity transaction. Joan Robinson: "As soon as one admits the uncertainty of the forecast that guide economic behaviour, equilibrium has no more importance and History takes its place".

- Det verkligt produktiva talar alltid med en stämma som är för stark för cybernetikens öron. Den når utom det raster en i enlighet med sin abstrakta funktion borde hålla sig till.

- Cybernetics is the construction of a real-time grid-ing system; that all living forms are captured by the grid is more important than the absolute control over it. In other words, cybernetics create a total transparency; an absolute correspondence between map and territory. "A will to knowledge accumulated to such degree that it becomes a will to power".
- The fear in cybernetics is not a fear of a certain threat, but the fear of any threat.
- The cybernetic control places itself in *central zero*. A place where disturbances are always registered but never affecting. Shock absorbers turn any violence into mere information. 
- All disturbances are systemic threats because they require a mobilisation of energy to be dealt with.
- Proximity policing is intended to ward off feedback of events.

- What replaces the cyberspace imaginary is the concept of "computer-aided".
