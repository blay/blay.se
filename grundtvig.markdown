## Mission statement:

Learning and use of internet as a tool for the autonomy of individuals and groups and for a more transparent democracy and citizen participation. Our target groups include: migrant women, senior citizens and adults who have had limited educational opportunities.  

Participating in this project will allow us to pool methodologies, materials and knowledge, and to generate synergies among them. At the same time, it will allow participants to learn more about the practices that take place in similar fields of knowledge in other countries, and as such to see the characteristics that we share and strengthen the feeling of belonging to Europe.

## Objectives:

- To promote participation and active citizenship through the use of ICTs
- To create a transnational network of cultural organisations that work with ICTs
- To favour cultural and intergenerational exchange
- To encourage participation in lifelong education activities
- To come up with new concepts and formulate thought that can be used as a tool to help us to interpret the present moment in history and to bring about social change.

- The idea is for each organisation to share the methodologies that they have expertise in, so that every organisation will learn new approaches that it can apply to its local context. 
- The project strategy aims to promote social cohesion by means of ICTs, and to improve the technical skills and abilities of disadvantaged persons and all those who are not “digital natives”, so that they can reach the levels of competitiveness that Europe requires. To this end, face-to-face activities such as meetings will be combined with virtual activities such as the project website, which will be regularly updated with content.
