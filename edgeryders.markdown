About the Edgeryders Project
----------------------------

This text will examine how edgeryders take political action and
participate in political processes. It will also see how the kinds of
participation that edgeryders are involved in differ from how European
youth policy imagine political participation and if it is possible to
bridge these differences.

That the Edgeryders project want to examine political participation
seems natural. One of the major ideas behind Edgeryders is that the
citizens are experts when it comes to their own lives and as experts
they should be involved in the policy process. Edgeryders explicitly
wants to define itself against a passive presentation of youth as a
problem category that policymakers and experts have to figure out and
come up with policies for. Therefor, Edgeryders itself is an experiment
in policy making that is based on a new kind of political participation.

Within the policy field there is a wide-spread concern about the state
of European youth. The economic crisis have hit the young people of
europe hard with high unemployment rates and there is concern about the
low numbers of youth participating in traditional political parties,
institutions and organizations. The concept of NEET (Not in Education,
Employment or Training) highlights concerns about a generation left out
of society, excluded from participation, influence and possibilities of
self-realization. The way Edgeryders want to counter this image is to
listen to the stories from young people themselves about how they build
a common future; making a living, socializing, learning and trying to
influence the world around them. By creating a platform that lets young
people speak for themselves about the topics they care about, Edgeryders
hope to show that youth are more active and creative in building this
common future than the negative concept of NEETs suggest.

Research Questions
------------------

The purpose of this research is to paint a picture of how edgeryders,
the young people in Europe creating futures on the edges, take political
action; how they view political institutions, how they participate in
protest movements and how they invent new ways of engaging politically
and invent new forms of political systems.

I will also undertake a critical reading of current European youth
policy to see how they try to engage youth in policy and how they view
the status of youth participation today. How is the relation between
citizen activism and political institutions imagined and what is
considered to be political participation?

From these empirical investigations I will identify gaps between how
edgeryders take political action and how the youth policies imagine
political participation.

From this I will identify possible bridges between the two realities.
How can they interact with each other, under what conditions, on whose
initiative?

Method
------

To get an overview of how edgeryders take part in political processes I
have conducted a study of the mission reports and comments to those
reports on the Edgeryders platform. This has primarily been focused on
the campaign ’’We, the People’’ which specifically dealt with political
participation. However, mission reports from other campaigns are also
relevant, such as ’’Caring for Commons’’, ’’Making a Living’’ and
’’Resilience’’. This is an important point, because as we shall see
edgeryders do not restrict their political participation to a separate
sphere but keep a holistic view on all the whole of their lives. In
exploring the site I have gone through all the mission reports in ’’We,
the People’’ and followed links to other campaigns as well as following
the most discussed mission reports. From this exploration, topics have
emerged that I feel gives an overview of the most crucial aspects of how
politics and participation are viewed from the edgeryders.

For the section of European youth policy I have analyzed several recent
official reports and documents from the Council of Europe and the
European Commission that focuses on youth policy. I have focused on but
not limited myself to documents about youth political participation
because those policies are also shaped by the general view of the
situation of youth in Europe today. From this material I have
constructed an analysis of how European youth policy considers the topic
of participation in the political process and what the aim of the youth
policy regarding participation is. I have also used some second hand
material from research on youth participation that gives larger
overviews of the field.

I addition to this primary material I have used secondary literature to
aid in the analysis. This has been research focusing on youth policy and
youth in general as well as the state of political institutions and
citizen participation in the political process. I have also relied on
political theory, primarily regarding new forms of political
participation that we can see examples of on Edgeryders and how these
forms can be interpreted. This comes in several categories that has been
chosen for how they correspond to forms of political participation I
have found in the mission reports. This is somewhat of a redundant
approach. Since the edgeryders are ’’citizen experts’’, they are of
course also self-reflexive and read and are inspired by theory, perhaps
the same theory that I use to analyze the forms of participation they
engage in. There are even references to this kind of literature in the
mission reports and discussions on Edgeryders. The use of this material
is therefor not only a way of externally interpreting the actions of
edgeryders but also to bring forth some of the *source material* within
these forms of participation. For example I rely sometimes on design
theory that in recent years have developed into a theory for the
practice of performing socio-technical interventions in a social field.
I also use theory from the hacking and free software communities as well
as contemporary political theory that form a part of todays protest
movements.

Structure of the text
---------------------

After this initial introduction, *section II* deals with the data from
the Edgeryders platform. After a more detailed look at how the
Edgeryders project officially talk about participation and how that has
structured the project I will describe the forms of participation found
in the mission reports on Edgeryders. I have devided these in three
categories; protests, systems and social innovation. ’’Protest’’ deals
with street protest movements, ’’systems’’ deal with the invention of
new kinds of political procedures and systems and ’’social innovation’’
deals with attempts to directly improve a certain situation or living
condition. After this description I will analyze the findings along
several dimensions: *First* how politics is situated and performed in
relation to other dimensions of life; *second* about process, goals and
continuity of political participation; *third* about horizontal
vs. vertical trust and the view of institutions and *forth*, taking a
look at what kind of participations seems to be missing from Edgeryders.

*Section III* deals with youth policy. This section begins with a
description of the current state of youth and participation as seen from
the perspective of youth policy. It then continues to describe the youth
policy itself, its aim, methods and how it wants to improve youth
participation. From this material I will deconstruct the idea of
participation as it is presented within youth policy. What kind of
participation is youth policy talking about? In what way and with what
influence does it expect youth to engage in politics and how is it
supposed that these process will be structures and managed? After this a
comparison highlighting the differences with Edgeryders in several
aspects is made. This deals with what counts as political, who sets the
agenda for participation and influence and if the very idea of a
separate policy for youth participation makes sense in light of the
findings from Edgeryders.

*Section IV* provides suggestions for policy improvements within the
area of youth participation. The aim of this section is neither to
broadcast my own views on youth policy, nor select specific form of
participation from Edgeryders and suggest them. Rather it is to point to
the rich source of experimentation with new political participation that
edgeryders are and suggest some methods and procedures for how to begin
to experiment with this. I highlight some themes of where there are gaps
today and where bridges could be constructed. The first is if
institutions should take the lead in the foreground or remain in the
background as support structure for citizen initiatives. The second
concerns how edgeryders and institutions could find common spaces and
concerns and work together. The third theme regard open government as an
u,brella concept for a new way of working together. And the forth theme
regards the idea of ’’prototyping cultures’’ as a form of participation
that embraces uncertainty, adhoc decisions and experimentation. Finally,
this section contains a part of the role of a project like Edgeryders in
shaping youth policy.

A final *section V* contains concluding remarks, a more philosophical
discussion on the concept of participation and suggestions for further
research.

Describing Edgeryders
=====================

Edgeryders and participation
----------------------------

As said in the introduction, apart from the topics discussed on the
platform, Edgeryders as a project (uppercase E) deals specifically with
participation from its users in the role of ’’citizen experts’’, here
called edgeryders (with lowercase e). This is reflected in the
presentation of Edgeryders as ’’the worlds largest think tank’’:

> Thanks to the web, we can collaborate on a massive scale to aggregate
> our expertise into the world’s largest think tank. This is what
> Edgeryders wants to be.
>
> (Edgeryders, n.d.)

Edgeryders is therefor both a way of gathering stories about responses
to the problem of political participation by young people as well as an
answer to its own concerns. These concerns are presented in a blog post
on Edgeryders from January 2012 discussing the new campaign ’’’’We, the
People’’:

> The reasoning behind this inquiry is that surveys point to a growing
> lack of involvement on youths’ part and a gloomy future of party
> politics. [...] Who will elect our officials if not a small minority?
> If indeed they are turning away, institutions are responsible to look
> into why this happens and how to bring them closer.

These concerns are also put in another light in a blog post in June 2012
reflecting on the then upcoming Edgeryders conference, calling for a new
vision of political participation for Europe to arrive as a response to
the crises it is now facing:

> We have so much creative freedom, so much scope to respond to our
> crises beyond the simple models of elections and parties, all the way
> through to new economies, wikipedia-type collaboration, changing
> cultures and changing goals. The future is wide open, and we hope to
> reach as far into it as possible, and lay the foundations for making
> it real at the European level.

Central to my survey of the mission reports and discussions on the
Edgeryders platform has been the campaign ’’We, the people’’(Edgeryders,
n.d.), as it dealt directly with political participation. The campaign
presents a picture of how young people are rejecting traditional
political participation:

> What is alarming for scholars and democracy advocates is that
> participation is no longer a natural result of stepping into
> adulthood, of taking up responsibilities, paying taxes etc, as it used
> to be.
>
> (Edgeryders, n.d.)

However, the campaign asks:

> The question is: to what extent they are disengaged? Or rather they
> are engaged differently?
>
> (Edgeryders, n.d.)

It then proceeds to suggest that the latter is true, citing examples
such as *the arab spring*, *Los Indignados* and the *Occupy protests*.
The campaign description also highlights how digital tools lower the
threshold of participation and create new channels for communication and
organizing, although it suggests that it is not certain if these new
forms of participation will lead to any lasting social change. Digital
technologies are also presented as something that can both create new
forms of interaction by citizens with political institutions and new
forms of surveillance by governments and other entities.

The campaign then presents four missions:

-   Reactivating democratic institutions (Edgeryders, n.d.)

    *This mission is about stories from traditional political
    participation.*

-   Taking it to the streets (Edgeryders, n.d.)

    *This mission captures experiences from street protests*\

-   Hacking for change (Edgeryders, n.d.)

    *This mission is about how technology aids political movements*

-   Spotlight: open government (Edgeryders, n.d.)

    *This mission takes a special look at how technical systems can
    foster participatory collaboration between citizens and governments*

Apart from ’’We’’, the people’’ I have incorporated mission reports from
other campaigns, the reason being that forms of political participation
can also be seen in practices that is not necessarily framed as a
political participation but is still about shaping the collective world
we live in. Stories from the introductory life stories from the mission
’’Share my ride’’ (Edgeryders, n.d.) fits here, as well as mission
reports form ’’Making a Living’’ (Edgeryders, n.d.) about jobs and
social innovation, ’’Caring for the Commons’’ (Edgeryders, n.d.) about
protecting and enhancing common resources and ’’Resilience’’
(Edgeryders, n.d.) about how society manages food and other vital
resources.

Forms of participation
----------------------

One thing that is striking about reading mission reports on the
Edgeryders platform is the richness and variety of political initiatives
being presented. It is not an easy task to categorize them and what I
have done here can be nothing more than an arbitrary sorting that does
not do justice to the heterogeneity of the examples. That said, there
seem to be two dominating themes that occur throughout the forms of
participation that is almost always mentioned. One is *the internet*,
the other is *crisis*. In one way or the other almost all of the mission
reports and discussions about political participation is either about
new opportunities enabled by widespread internet access and digital
technologies or about the challenges that some version of the triple
crises of economy, ecology and energy presents. This has at least two
consequences. One is that there is a lack of trust in established ways
of doing politics. Not necessarily lack of trust in the sense that
institutions are mistrusted (although that is not uncommon), but a lack
of trust that institutions and political structures are either equipped
to face new political challenges, utilize new participatory
opportunities or equipped to be able to adapt to the new circumstances.
Edgeryder Jonathan Sundqvist exemplifies this sentiment with his
experiences with working with citizen journalism for the climate
meetings at COP15

> Perhaps it was around that time I started to feel that I wasn’t able
> to do enough or the right things. It was the most stressful time of my
> life participating during those meetings. So much going on all the
> time, but at the same time, nothing. It was moving at a snail’s pace.

> Sheer frustration.

> People were talking. But nothing was happening. As you may know it’s
> still going on, with little movement forward.
>
> (Sundqvist, n.d.)

The other consequence is that no one really knows what to do next. Or
rather, there are contending proposals of what to do next, but no
consensus of how to proceed. This leads to a situation where there is
lots of trial and error and many small scale experiments, both failing
and succeeding rapidly. There is also a lot of imitation, adaption and
mutation of each others forms of participation since the internet spread
ideas rapidly and youth in different regions find themselves in similar
situations.

For the purpose of analysis I have divided the forms of participation in
three categories: *protests*, *systems* and *social innovation*. I have
chosen not to have a category for participation in formal political
institutions partly because there are few accounts of this and partly
because the story of those participations have already been widely
researched. I will however mention some examples in passing.

### Protests

The first category is one that on the surface at least feels familiar:
street protests. This area has in the recent year in Europe been
dominated by three big phenomena that are all represented in Edgeryders:
the Anti-ACTA protests, Occupy protests and Los Indignados. The ACTA
protests has had a peculiar relation to political institutions, so I
will wait with that and begin with the two latter which has been more
strictly grassroots oriented and has had an antagonistic or at least
indifferent stance towards political institutions.

Both the Occupy protests and Indignados has several characteristics that
is typical for movements of this generation. They are both exploratory
in the sense that a clear problem space has been identified (although
not strictly defined or limited) but there is no formal demands directed
to any decision makers. Instead, both movements experiment with new ways
of tackling the political problems with new forms of participation, new
ways of connecting issues and struggles and from there trying to
articulate, in practice and in theory, alternative ways of being and
acting politically. Both movements also seem to have broken through a
tipping point of social tabu, releasing personal frustration and
emotions in broad segments of the population and exposing things in
public that has previously been kept private. They have by and large
been successful in capturing and directing currents that already existed
in society but in an unarticulated form. Currents whose direction was
ambiguous and could just as easily have been captured for example by
far-right movements. Both movements started as central public gatherings
and has since dispersed out into several diverse initiatives.

The Anti-ACTA protests differ from Occupy and Indignados in the sense
that they are primarily directed toward influencing decision makers
within political institutions, rather than articulating alternatives
within the movement itself (though this is not saying that alternatives
are not articulated and worked out in the process). The Anti-ACTA
protests, like other net activism movements before them, is interesting
because they target issues that are normally perceived to be just an
administrative matter and turn them into contested political issues. The
the case of ACTA — the negotiations of a trade agreement. As a
consequence, there is no clear divide among the political parties on
this issue. No one ’’owns’’ this issue or a position on it and this can
create interesting political alliances.

> An unintended consequence of this political diversity on the streets
> was that neither politicians nor media had a clue how to describe the
> movement, how to narrate about it nor categorize it. [...] It turned
> out that neither media nor politicians are able to handle truly
> grass-roots, spontaneous initiatives focused on particular issues,
> functioning over (or away from!) the usual political and social
> divides.
>
> (rysiek, n.d.)

Not only does issues like this create new political alliances but since
neither media nor politicians have an established routine for handling
them, especially when they target a part of the political process that
rarely interacts with citizens, it opens up political space for
unexpected turns. In the case of Anti-ACTA in Poland, this is best
exemplified with the 7 hour long debate between the activists and the
polish prime minister.

Drawing from my own personal experience of the ACTA protests as well as
engaging as activist in the process of negotiation of the European
Telecoms Package, I can also tell that these are great collective
learning experiences where a loosely connected but tightly
interconnected swarm of people learn about the political procedures,
committees, reports and power relations within the European policy body
*in real-time*.

### Systems

This category captures initiatives that in some way involves
constructing new systems for political participation. They often involve
digital technology and some actual software, but must not necessarily do
so as long as it involves constructing some formal procedures and rule
sets for enabling participation. This participation can both be
participation in the formal political process of political institutions
from the city level to the European, but it can also be structured
participation among peers. The inspiration for these systems comes from
the online world and the many social networks and communication
platforms found there and how they seem to be able to organize and
create participation in ways and on a scale that was not possible before
the internet. The distributed encyclopedia of Wikipedia, the free
operative system of GNU Linux and similar initiatives are highlighted as
forerunners.

One recurring theme here is that of *sharing*. Free software and the
internet in general has created an inspiring culture of sharing and
co-production that these system builders tries to adapt to other
phenomena in society. As one edgeryder puts in:

> It’s possible to create a whole lifestyle based on sharing without
> joining a commune. Car sharing, co-housing, co-working, yard sharing,
> bike sharing, tool sharing and other innovations are growing in
> popularity. And they do not require you to give up your privacy,
> individuality or even ownership of your stuff.
>
> (Gorenflo, n.d.)

One prolific cluster of initiatives are the ones that go under the
banner of *Open Data*. This is initiatives that see a participatory
potential in governments opening up their information databases for the
public to use and engage with. This would allow citizens to engage
directly with the heart of political institutions in their daily labour
instead of only interactive with representatives. The motivation for
this can be that citizens have the right to follow the governance
institutions work in real-time to be able to hold them accountable, but
it can just as well be seen as a cooperation between government and
citizens to create better services and use of the data where small
citizen initiatives can act in more agile ways than institutions:

> With open data it seems quite clear that hacktivists and civil society
> organizations are just way better and faster than government agencies
> in performing some of the related operations
>
> (Cottica, n.d.)

The way these initiatives have proliferated so far is in many cases that
a group of citizen enthusiasts manages to get in contact with an
’’insider’’ who is either knowledgable in software or ust enthusiastic
about the idea. An example from the Italian ’’Spaghetti Open Data’’
initiative showed how ’’a couple of civil servants  joined forces with
hackers from the Open Knowledge Fondation and the Guardian’s datablog to
release a fantastic dataset on public expenditure in a fully open and
interactive form’’ (Cottica, n.d.).

Another example from Edgeryders where open data is combined with a
structure for participation is ’’the concept of ’’Participatory
Budgeting’’. Participatory budgeting is an attempt to, in a systemic
way, structure the interaction between governing institutions and
citizens. This is not without its critics and participatory budgeting
has been criticized sometimes for being too much of a top-down
initiative that is focused on improving and enriching the work of
political institutions rather than focusing on citizens own initiatives.
This view is expressed in a comment on Edgeryders:

> My strong critique is that PB is [...] just like a nice tool in the
> hand of politicians to better involve citizens, and not the contrary.
> [...] Therefore, citizens come to award them, rather than themselves,
> and keep thinking as a service offered rather than a right achieved!
>
> (Stortone, n.d.)

This problem of how participation is facilitated, on whose initiative
and on what term is something that will be dealt with more in the
section on European youth policy and the one with my suggestions for
improvements.

### Social innovation and direct improvements

The final category is what I call social innovation and direct
improvements. Like the name suggest, this is about initiatives that
directly try to improve the living conditions in a certain situation,
together with other peers and without going through the representing
phase of trying to influence a decision makers within a political
institution to do something about the problem. Social innovation has
become something of a buzzword lately and often refers to projects that
both improve social conditions *and* make a profit. However, the way I
interpret the term, it doesn’t have to involve making a profit. The
profit is there to enable the project to sustain itself over time and
this can also be accomplished through other means such as pubic funding
or by volunteer efforts.

An example of social innovation is found in an Edgeryders report from
Sicily about the Addiopizzo initiative (Zabatino, n.d.). This can be
described as a variation of the *Fair Trade* motif but being about
supporting Sicilian restaurants who refuse to pay bribes to the mafia.
The initiative is started by a group of young people in Palermo.

> Addiopizzo is a non-partisan movement and a volunteer association that
> opposes the Mafia System. It promotes a virtuous economic system free
> from the control of the Mafia through a project called " Critical
> Consumption’’
>
> (Zabatino, n.d.)

The ’’Critical Consumption’’ project started as a way to index and
support those restaurants that dared to challenge the practice of paying
bribes to the mafia.

> Critical Consumption is a project that wants to support merchants who
> do not submit to the extortion racket, creating a network of aware
> consumers who commit themselves to go to those merchants for their
> purchases.
>
> (Zabatino, n.d.)

Addiopizzo incorporates several characteristics common to social
innovation projects.

-   They start in a single, but radical, issue or demand.

-   They present an achievable solution but that is challenging
    structures

-   They involve multiple stakeholders, tend to go viral, and are based
    on building a community

-   They practice ’’Design in use’’(Björgvinsson, Ehn, & Hillgren, 2010)
    and expand issues as more stakeholders become involved

Social innovation is also the form of political participation that
blends most with other aspects of life. It can be hard to distinguish
social innovation as political participation from other ways of simply
improving ones living conditions together with others. An example of how
a social innovation initiative that directly improves living conditions
is the one of the occupation of Teatro Valle in Rome, which is part of a
series of theatre occupations across Italy. The mission report about
this occupation paints a picture of how what started as occupations to
try to prevent the closure of theatre turned into a hub for social
experimentation in the neighborhoods where they were located:

> Meanwhile, every day these spaces are clean, open and alive with a
> varied, continuous, hybrid programmation, accessible to all with the
> help of all the artists and workers, including some of great fame:
> workshops, performances of all kinds, Sundays for children,
> after-school care for children (in Sicilian spaces), the barter
> markets (Naples), seminars on copyleft and creative commons, a desk to
> legal support and business planning support (Coppola Theatre), history
> lessons (Nuovo Cinema Palazzo), readings, projections, trump
> tournaments in the summer for the elderly (Nuovo Cinema Palazzo).
>
> (Zabatino, n.d.)

Through direct improvements of living conditions, new forms of
participation and political relations can emerge:

> The social and cultural value is produced because these spaces have
> become places of artistic and sociological research and
> experimentation, places where we take care of his own cities and
> citizens, places where you implement new social policies based on co -
> operation and identification of real urgencies.
>
> (Zabatino, n.d.)

Analysis of Participation on Edgeryders
---------------------------------------

### Where is politics located?

One striking aspect of the mission reports about political participation
is that the political can turn up anywhere in relation to other
practices of life. Political participation is not seen as a special
sphere of life and it does not have a designated time and place such as
it would have if one would engage in a political organization after work
or school.

There are clear examples of this on Edgeryders, for example a post
called ’’Being paid for doing what you like - still impossible’’
(lucyanna, n.d.) where the mission report starts out with a quite
personal discussion about the dilemma of having to choose between
getting paid for doing a job you are not uncomfortable with and doing
what you like but not get rewarded financially for it. The options that
the poster sees is only getting by with temporary jobs while trying to
find time for ones passion or moving away to a place where one can live
of very little. The discussion in the comment field however quickly
turns to a discussion of the political situation that brought this
dilemma about and political actions and alternative economic systems
that could solve this it such as time-banks, alternative currencies,
ways of sharing resources.

The Edgeryders platform has also been successful in encouraging people
to tell stories from their own life situations and then have an active
team and community that encourages wider reflection in the discussions.

### Process, outcome and continuity

Most of the examples of participation on Edgeryders, although there are
exception, could be called process oriented. Rather than using any means
to work towards a well defined goal, they aim to establish procedures
and form of interaction where political discussions and actions are made
possible. This can be seen in protest movements as well as the system
building and social innovation. As is expressed in an interview with a
participant of Los Indignados posted on Edgeryders (Paola, n.d.), in
examples such as occupy and Indignados, this has been criticized from
outsiders as a weakness. But from within the movements it is rather seen
as an indication that they are trying to address the roots of the
contemporary political situation rather than trying to fix problems on
the surface.

One can link this to a larger societal trend of moving from formal modes
of interaction to experiment with open-ended forms of participation. Not
only in political action but also regarding for example innovation in
the business world (von Hippel, 2005). This is of course correlated to
the rise of networked communication technologies.

For political action though there are some problems associated with this
form of participation and that is a widespread problem with continuity.
Since participation is mostly based on time- and resource consuming
volunteer efforts and a process-oriented practice is based on continuous
involvement without ever really reaching a plateau where political gains
are institutionalized and secured, it can easily lead to individual and
collective burn-out. For the corporate world, this is rarely a problem
because they have an abundance of resources to throw at this process
year after year, but in the time- and resource scarce world of volunteer
political engagement, this becomes a real problem.

Open-ended, networked and process-oriented participation is very
prolific in getting things started, gathering people, spreading
information and working up an energy for a new form of participation in
the beginning of a project, but after the initial phase it can be
problematic to solidify the initial achievements. In the comment section
of the post on Addiopizzo this is discussed:

> finally, it’s also a metter of energy and forces: at the very
> beginning ADDIOPIZZO was something innovative and very fascinating,
> now there are less people involved (for different reasons….) : the
> increase in the number of shops in the list was much higher in a
> couple of years and it was not proportional.
>
> (Zabatino, n.d.)

This problem is also recognized in my field of design research where
participatory research projects that work with social design
intervention in people lives have become more common the last years.
Sometimes called ’’The Project Fallacy’’, a re-occuring problem is that
between interventions that require long-term commitments to achieve the
desired impact and funding structures that premiers short-term
contracts. As a result, many projects end up involving a lot of
stakeholders in a promising effort, but when the funding is drained and
the project ends, the situation goes back to what it was before the
intervention and no change has actually been achieved.

Edgeryders user “demsoc” describes this problem in his work on the UK
initiative “We Live Here” that “tried to create a civic space by
networking the networks that already exist in the community”(demsoc,
n.d.). Projects initiated from the outside of communities can be seen
negatively by the affected participants.

What “We Live Here” instead did was to map and make use of already

> (demsoc, n.d.)

There is a scaling problem with many of the Edgeryders projects that
stay as local initiatives (some of the systems solutions though is
scalable in an information system sense).

Perhaps political institutions, such as the state, is necessary to
handle the scaling issues of multiple local initiatives.

There are several reasons why scaling issues are absent. One is that
edgeryders, as other people, are most engaged in what is immediately
relevant to them and their communities. That means that direct
improvement of local conditions is a present issue while global climate
change, melting of polar ice or regional waste management is less
present (except from as a background story). Another reason is that
there is a skepticism that the scale necessary to solve those issues
will be a viable path. Either that working on that scale, for example
with the state, is closed, or that those larger networks and supply
chains necessary for action on that scale will simply break down and
local communities will have to manage their own resilience, as described
in the report on the resilience session at the Edgeryders conference
(LucasG, n.d.).

### What participation is missing?

As I mentioned in the introduction, what I present is inevitably a
simplified overview of how political participation is presented at the
Edgeryders platform, but it must also be said that the stories of the
edgeryders are not covering all the forms of political participation
that youth in Europe is active in. It can be worthwhile to ask also who
is and is not present on Edgeryders and what forms of political
participation is missing from these accounts.

Since Edgeryders is a technical platform on the internet and a platform
that one becomes aware about mostly through social media, there is
naturally a risk that non-techsavvy communities becomes excluded.
Communities that are either don’t have access to or are unable to use
computers and the internet as well as people who use the internet but
are not well-connected or connected in other ways than with those links
that lead to the Edgeryders platform. Perhaps people who mostly use
media for consumption rather than interaction. It is also quite telling
that most forms of participation presented on Edgeryders make heavy use
of social media and other internet tools to organize or communicate.

The other forms of participation that potentially is excluded from
Edgeryders are the ones that are not represented in a public way, either
because they are illegal or because there is a social stigma associated
with them. While it is possible to use pseudonyms on Edgeryders, most
users have their real name and/or a profile picture showing their face.
Either case it is rarely hard to find out who is behind a post. As an
example, while people on Edgeryders are open about participating in
protest movements such as Occupy and Los Indignados, I find no accounts
from any of the young people that took part in the London riots. While I
am sure many policy makers would denounce that activity, their voices
are important to get a full understanding of the desires and feelings of
young people in Europe today and what view they have on formal political
institutions.

Beyond being a problem of representation, many of the accounts of
political participation on Edgeryders deal with responses to the current
economic crisis and some the communities that are not present are
perhaps the young Europeans that are hit the hardest by the crisis,
already being in vulnerable living conditions and without much space for
social maneuverability. This is also problematized in the ethnographic
report on Edgeryders by Rebecca Collins and Valentina Cuzzocrea:

> Although participants in this project have represented a diverse set
> of backgrounds and experiences, they have also been a self-selecting
> group of privileged actors, which means that inevitably some voices
> are missing. Furthermore, the mission reports have been shaped by the
> questions posed within the campaigns and, as a result, Edgeryders
> stories have usually been framed around the positive actions they are
> taking as they navigate their transitions. In short, it must be
> acknowledged that there is a risk of reading these stories in too
> positive a light.
>
> (Collins & Cuzzocrea, n.d.)

Overview of Youth Policy
========================

State of youth and participation
--------------------------------

Before getting into how European youth policy view political
participation it is important to understand how policymakers understand
the new landscape of young people. There is a widespread notion that the
life of youth today is radically different than previous generations, a
change fueled by information technology, media and markets. As
summarized by Linda Herrera:

> There is indeed something new about youth and part of this newness, as
> articulated in the World Youth Report 2005, can be found in the
> ascendancy of youth oriented media, markets and ICT worldwide, in the
> formation of ever newer forms of youth cultural production from music
> to fashion and film, the emergence of new forms of political
> organization and social movements, and consequently, new patterns of
> youth socialization.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

Another dominating theme in youth policy apart form this new landscape
is the notion of crisis. As the European commission writes in the report
’’An EU Strategy for Youth’’:

> Globalisation can bring growth and jobs, but it can also bring about
> specific challenges for vulnerable workers such as youth, as
> demonstrated by the crisis.
>
> (Commission, 2009)

Youth, with little work experience, has been hit hard by the crisis.
Some youth is more vurneable than others, but as cuts in education
affect who is able to go into studies when the job market for young an
uneducated is poor, more and more young people become part of the group
of youth that the crisis affects hard.

This all lead to a situation where youth is facing great uncertainty,
which is reflected in the concerns of the youth policies. As summarized
by Titley in a background paper to ’’8th Council of Europe Conference of
Ministers responsible for Youth’’:

> Indeed if there is a core theme running through the different issues
> youth policy and work will have to address in relation to the work
> priorities, it may well be the idea of precariousness.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

Yet, in this precarious situation, Titley recognizes ’’the new range of
opportunities and possibilities many young people have in what can
loosely be termed our knowledge societies’’(Titley, 2008) and that there
is ’’a strong tendency towards freedom of cultural expression,
creativity and individualism paves the way for young people today, who
identify themselves as cultural producers and carriers of innovation and
new forms of expression’’(Titley, 2008).

This situation with crisis and uncertainty on the one hand and new
opportunities and a new culture of participation on the other hand leads
to a complicated relation to traditional political participation. Titley
again:

> Young people are highly positive towards democracy, although they are
> often critical towards the way institutions work
>
> (Titley, 2008)

In the light of this, the challenge for youth policy could be said not
to be so much about activating youth to participate (although for
certain youth groups this could be the case) but to find a way to align
the work of political institutions with the expectations and practices
of todays young people in order to regain legitimacy among them.

This lack of trust in political institutions is partly due to
disappointing experiences with engagement in political institutions and
partly due to a feeling the political institutions are not capable of
handling the new, complex issues that the world is facing today. Titley
again:

> The decline in memberships in formal organisations is often related to
> notions of individualisation in late capitalist societies, where
> people - not just the young - are compelled to fall back on
> biographical resources and solutions in response to wider structural
> and social issues, and where collective action does not seem possible
> in relation to opaque and distant agency in questions of economy and
> social resources.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

The reluctance to engage in institutional politics is also due to a gap
between what is perceived as distant social forces and the lack of
influence over these from the institutional bodies. In the light of this
it makes sense that youth participation both take on more local forms
that directly improve living conditions and more global forms which
rises over what is considered the day to day administrative notion of
institutions.

This situation creates some challenges for youth policy since many areas
outside of the traditional concerns of youth policy influence young
peoples attitudes towards the political sphere. As the European
Commission writes in the above mentioned report:

> Difficulties in education, employment, inclusion and health, further
> combined to problems in finance, housing or transport, make it
> difficult for young people to achieve autonomy, a situation where they
> have the resources and opportunities to manage their own lives, fully
> participate in society and decide independently.
>
> (Commission, 2009)

As can be seen, many of these areas have neither to do with
participation, nor with youth per se.

Another concern for youth policy is that within the globalized world of
new networked subjectivities and new means of participation, a
significant part of young people participate in reactionary movements
that hardly embrace the new times.

> A major concern is how to ascertain the conditions without adult
> mediation, which type of youth identify with a given movement, for
> they range dramatically on the spectrum from peaceful, creative and
> progressive, to reactionary and violent.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

Intention of Youth Policy
-------------------------

EU programs for youth policy has been in place since 1988, however the
intentions behind youth policy has varied(Commission, 2009). Sometimes,
youth has been seen as problematic collection of people that needs to be
guided through the transition to adulthood so that they don’t fall into
any traps(Besley, 2009). If this fails, the youth justice system has to
take over and try to get the youth back on track(Besley, 2009).

Not all policy has this view of youth though. The report ’’An EU
Strategy for Youth’’ from the European Commission has the following to
say:

> Young people are not a burdensome responsibility but a critical
> resource to society which can be mobilised to achieve higher social
> goals.
>
> (Commission, 2009)

The Council of Europe share a similar view on youth:

> Fundamentally, the approach of the Council of Europe’s youth sector to
> youth policy is one that aims to support young people’s participation
> as a citizen and their - often complex - transition to autonomy.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

In the article ’’Moving youth participation forward’’, O’Donoghue et.al.
states that “Youth development researchers have noted a shift in youth
work in the past two decades from prevention (programs designed to treat
and prevent the problems of “at-risk” youth) to preparation” (O’Donoghue
& Kirshner, 2002). Youth are to be prepared to face the challenges of
the transition to adulthood in a self-governing manner. In this
preparedness, political participation is seen as a key:

> Europe’s youth need to be equipped to take advantage of opportunities
> such as civic and political participation, volunteering, creativity,
> entrepreneurship, sport and global engagement.
>
> (Commission, 2009)

The importance of participation from the perspective of youth policy is
also reflected in its inclusion in the United Nations ’’Convention on
the Rights of the Child’’.

The figure of the youth seems to embody the fears and hopes of our
society. As Linda Herrera states in an assessment of youth policy:

> It is more likely that youth has been propelled into the development
> spotlight due to the mounting awareness of the potential roles of
> young people in forging more stable, democratic and economically
> prosperous societies. Conversely, when development goes awry, they can
> also represent forces of instability, radicalism and impoverishment.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

Youth are seen as crucial actors living on the edge, invested with the
responsibility of determining the future direction of our societies.
Today, knowledge and education, entrepreneurship and initiative,
innovation and creativity are projected on the youth. Precisely the
properties that society hopes to see in the future.

XXX names this oscillation between stepping back and allowing
self-governance while retaining control ’’governmentality’’. The term
comes from Foucault…

Edgeryders hardly present youth as troubled and in need of guidance, but
rather as capable of self-governance and taking bottom-up initiatives.
The youth presenting themselves at Edgeryders hardly seem like these
troubled youth and perhaps this is a gap in the representation of
European youth at the platform. Edgeryders highlight the problematic
position of governmentality between self-governess and control.
Edgeryders presents youth that is quite capable of self-governing and
participating in new ways in the political process, perhaps with some
support structures.

The Idea of Participation
-------------------------

While it is considered a key factor for youth policy, it is still often
unclear what is meant by participation. It can both refer to policy that
’’empower adolescents to take part in and influence decision making that
affects their lives’’(O’Donoghue & Kirshner, 2002) or supporting youth
to take their own initiatives that shape their own future.

The distinction matters because it leads to very different perspectives
on youth policy. Consider this quote from a European Commission report
on youth policy:

> Policy-makers must adapt to communicating in ways receptive to young
> people - including on civic and European issues - particularly in
> order to attract unorganised or disadvantaged youth.
>
> (Commission, 2009)

This sentence suggests a perspective where the working of the European
institutions are in no need of change. It is only required that they
communicate in such a way that it convinces young people to be attracted
to the institutions way of working.

Titley also expresses something similar in his report for the Council of
Europe:

> The unique co-management system in the sector - where governmental and
> youth representatives have equal votes - is evidence of meaningful
> experience in youth participation.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

Government and youth representatives have equal influence over the
decisions being made, but this still says nothing about how the agenda
is formulated and what decision to be made is decided or how the policy
is worked out. Youth representatives are participating as a sort of
focus group that should give their view on already formulated proposals.

There is reason to be careful of how the concept of participation is
used so that it does not end up in participation without influence. As
O’Donoghue et.al. Says:

> Inserting one or a few youth into an adult-created and adult-driven
> process runs the risk of involving youth as tokens or “decorations”.
>
> (O’Donoghue & Kirshner, 2002)

Simply participating in a process that is already defined does not
guarantee real influence. The Council of Europe charter on youth policy
broadens the view of participation:

> Participation in the democratic life of any community is about more
> than voting or standing for election …, it is about having the right,
> the means, the space, the opportunity and, where necessary, the
> support to participate in and influence decisions and engage in
> actions and activities so as to contribute to building a better
> society.
>
> (Gozdzik-Ormel, 2008)

The definition of participation is broadened here to include ’’means’’
and ’’space’’ to participate in ’’actions and activities’’ that
“contribute to building a better society”. This also encompasses
engaging in activities that influence the scope, agenda and process of
political participation.

Differences between Youth Policy and Edgeryders
-----------------------------------------------

### What counts as political?

As seen in the section describing the mission reports of Edgeryders,
youth engage on a daily basis in initiatives that aim to better the
lives of them and their peers. Political participation is not seen as a
separate activity set apart from other matters of everyday life but an
ongoing collective effort to improve conditions of life.

Youth policy tends to view political participation as a special form of
activity that constitutes a clear break with everyday life. It is almost
as if youth is understood to have to take a break from their lives to
able to engage in political participation. What Edgeryders have shown is
instead that political participation often is a continuation of everyday
life.

### Who sets the agenda?

One observation from the Edgeryders platform is that many of the issues
that edgeryders engage with are issues that in mainstream politics are
not considered as political issues. The way this generation has
politicized copyright and intellectual property is an example and we are
now seeing for example new concerns for the commons as an extension of
this. A major issue with youth policy is therefor how to provide spaces
for the formulation of these new issues.

As it stands now, youth policy is focused on fostering participation in
decisions within areas that is already defined as influencing the lives
of young people. The problem however is often not (only) that the wrong
decisions are being made, but that there is no policy working on the
issues that young people are discovering as important. The youth active
on Edgeryders would hardly settle for being included as taking part in
decision at the end of a process where the problem has already been
formulated.

### Where is participation taking place?

The natural perspective from youth policy is to think of participation
as meaning participation in the political processes of institutions or
in campaigns initiated by the political institutions. However, what we
see on Edgeryders is that youth today is creating their own spaces for
participation, creating their own platforms for expression and debate
and are perhaps on their way of inventing new kinds of institutions.

Youth policy tries to bring young people into their political processes
by various campaign and initiatives to increase participation while
edgeryders are already active in their own spaces and platforms.

### Should youth policy even exist?

When formulating new perspectives on youth policy, one has to also
grapple with the whole concept of ’’youth’’ and how that category is
changing. The category of youth is a historical construct that changes
meaning in different eras. As Herrera points out in her examination of
youth policy:

> The notion of youth as a cultural group emerged in the post-World War
> II era when young people with access to markets and goods were
> distinguished by certain tastes, lifestyle choices and patterns of
> consumption.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

Youth assert themselves as a category when radical societal shifts map
themselves on generations. Youth is not a fixed age category, but a
social phenomena whose age stretch varies over time. Today, rapid shifts
in technology, new communications, media and new organizational tools as
well as a particular position in relation to the current economical
crisis makes it possible to speak of youth today. Although it must be
said that this category is not mapped on a specific age group more than
statistically in the sense that most people falling in the category of
tech-savvy, precarious Europeans are of a relatively young age. But
Edgeryders shows that this social group also consist of people up into
their 40’s.

Likewise, not all young people fall into the social group represented on
Edgeryders. Titley elaborates on the difficulty of diversity of young
people for youth policy:

> This diversity is a constant challenge for the work of the youth
> sector; to maintain an overall vision of the political, economic and
> socio-cultural processes which impact on young people without allowing
> these broader patterns to obscure local, national and regional
> differences, not to mention the specific material conditions,
> identities and life possibilities of young people in their
> environments.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

Youth participation should not have as an objective to represent a
common voice for young people, since such voice does not exist. Perhaps
instead of youth policy, it would be better to have policy especially
for emerging forms of participation, whether that came from young
people, senior citizens of a combination of the two.

Suggestion for Policy
=====================

Aim of this section
-------------------

The aim of this section is to provide suggestions for how the gap
between edgeryders and current youth policy can be bridged in a way that
take into considerations the experiences of Edgeryders and the new
participatory environment that edgeryders are creating. Since I am both
speaking for myself as a researcher here as well as trying to sound the
voices of Edgeryders, I will clarify what the aim of this section is.

The purpose of this section is not for me as a researcher to suggest a
specific policy improvement that I am in favor of. Neither is it to
select a few of the many initiatives on the Edgeryders platform as
suggest to implement them. Rather, my aim is to describe a process that
could bridge this gap by highlighting 4 key themes or areas where policy
needs to change.

Thematic suggestions
--------------------

### Foreground and background

The first theme is about the question weather institutions should be in
the foreground or reside into the background of youth political
participation. It used to be that youth policy around participation was
focused on bringing youth into the institutional forms of participation.
Herrera:

> In the past, political parties and formal youth organizations such as
> youth councils with links to formal government structures represented
> the standard form of youth participation, but this is no longer the
> case.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

What we have seen on Edgeryders is how youth are active in creating
their own initiatives and spaces that work with different kinds of
procedures and practices than institutional politics. Can there then be
a new role for institutions as background support for these initiatives,
rather than trying to orchestrate a political participation?

Institutions have several downsides that makes them less fit to take
charge of the process of participation. Compared to new forms of
communication and organization they are slow. However once they turn to
action they have an impact that small grassroots initiatives have a hard
time aggregating.

Many of the initiatives displayed on Edgeryders is about creating new
social infrastructures based on commons and sharing. Here is a possible
point where institutions could provide support. To try to create policy
that is fit to these new lifestyles as well as trying to see what
support structures are suitable. An example of edgeryders recognizing
the infrastructural role of institutions can be seen in the mission
report ’’Interview with a Sharer’’:

> And second, the time you free up by sharing and living more simply can
> be used to get engaged in issues that affect your lifestyle. For
> instance, going car-free is a lot easier if there’s plenty of bike
> lanes and good public transportation. These are community issues that
> you can’t work toward alone. You have to get involved in your
> community to make sure your tax dollars are spent in ways that make
> simpler living possible.
>
> (Gorenflo, n.d.)

Even though voting levels are declining young people still seem to value
the democratic foundations that institutional politics provide. As
highlighted by this quote:

> While voting levels have declined in many countries, it is clear that
> young people have voted in significant numbers when elections are seen
> to be central to continued democratic functioning, and where single
> issues become closely associated with particular governments.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

This shows that institutional politics for youth is a recognized
important backdrop, a political infrastructure of sorts, but is unlikely
to be the primary target for political engagement since youth find other
more meaningful ways of engaging. Perhaps the issues of young people are
both more global and more local than the national or regional level of
institutional politics.

It becomes a problem if young people are working more and more
effectively in non-governmental and informal organizations, building up
new capacities for actions, spreading ideas quickly and form new
networks; while at the same time the public institutions remains fixed
and are not influenced by this capacity. The further this goes, the less
possible it will be to form dialogues and make the informal
organizations able to influence policy.

The question is if this needs to be a matter of bringing young people
*into* the public institutions or if the public and the informal
organizations can cooperate in hybrid spaces around common
matters-of-concern without having to take place within the umbrella of
the public institutions. An example of this would be learning. Compare
the difference between young people influencing school policy and the
way their schools work versus young people creating new learning spaces
outside of the school system altogether such as hackerspaces, reading
groups, free schools and online based learning communities.

Looking at the Edgeryders platform it seems as if it is the latter, to
create alternative spaces, that is the one where young people see
opportunities today, aided by digital communication and networking
technologies. Although young people are developing alternative spaces,
it does not mean that they are not influenced by decisions taken within
public institutions. But it is not always decisions within a narrowly
defined department that affects them the most. For example it might not
be policy on education that influences the creation of alternative
learning spaces the most, but urban development, property prices or
intellectual property. This highlights a need for multidisciplinary and
multi-institutional approaches to looking at issues that youth cares
about.

### Common spaces and concerns

If we forget a while about separating between participating in
institutional politics on the one hand and self-organized initiatives on
the other hand, there seem to be a common concern in reactivating a
collective care for the commons in society. Titley suggests the term of
’’democratic partnership’’(Titley, 2008) and I choose to adopt it here
to name a process consisting of a common space where institutions and
citizens share common concerns and collaborate to solve problems.

These spaces blossom spontaneously anywhere when citizens find a
’’matter of concern’’(Latour, 2004) and it is not always the formal
political organizations that spawn this activity, as the anti-ACTA
protests in Poland shows:

> What is essential (and very interesting in and of itself), these were
> completely spontaneous, grass-roots activities, not associated with
> NGOs that had been bringing up the ACTA problem for years
>
> (rysiek, n.d.)

A challenge for institutions if this partnership is going to be formed
is therefor to locate these spontaneous initiatives and respond to them
in a meaningful way before it is too late.

On the other hand, the spontaneous initiatives might need the
institutions in order to make sure the initial enthusiasm translate into
lasting political change. O’Donoghue writes:

> In other words, supporters of youth participation must be open to the
> unique voices and contributions of youth, but they also must help
> youth learn how to recognize the norms of the public arena or the
> specific practices of the field in which they hope to participate.
> This is not so that youth will merely adopt these norms, but so that
> they can be effective in shaping broader arenas.
>
> (O’Donoghue & Kirshner, 2002)

There is in general a considerable lack of knowledge among young people
as to how the public institutions function and what their role and
purpose are. As well as how to reach and influence them effectively.
From personal experience I can say that political campaigns around net
politics has relied heavily on a few older activists and insiders in the
institutions to be able to guide the activity through the bureaucratic
jungle of european institutions.

Political institutions can also have a role in making sure that the
space of common concern is open to everyone and that citizens are not
only represented by a tech-savvy elite among young people. Titley
recognizes this:

> In order to ensure full and equal participation of all citizens,
> special priority should be given to special needs groups. This may
> involve encouraging more spontaneous and non-traditional forms of
> youth participation, and creative and innovative activities which are
> beyond the usual scope of established programmes.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

This is especially true when political participation rests on the
ability to individually locate and build active networks of
participants, mostly by making skilled use of information technology.
While ICT has made communication and organizing widely accessible, cheap
and easy, it is important to remember that all youth don’t have access
to these tools or the knowledge to use them. Titley again:

> While knowledge-based economies tend to privilege young people in the
> labour market, they may also tend to disproportionately provide
> increased opportunities for the socially privileged while amplifying
> the vulnerability of the socially disadvantaged.
>
> (Titley, 2008)

### Open Government

A potential common space of which there are some examples on the
Edgeryders platform is what goes under the umbrella term of ’’open
government’’. Here we find several kinds of initiatives that aim to upen
up governance to a more transparent and participatory ways doing. I will
reflect on this term here, give positive examples as well as highlight
some critique of the idea of open government which could be solved by
the right kind of institutional involvement.

In a comment to a post discussing open government and lack of trust in
institutions, Alberto says:

> bridging this trust gap with information and open conversation is
> exactly what open government does best
>
> (MarukomuC, n.d.)

By making governance transparent and creating tools for involving
citizens in governance processes, open government hope to bridge the gap
between citizens and political institutions. Open government is also
seen as a way to depart from an idea of participation where the citizen
is not engaged as a active equal of the government in managing the
affairs of the state.

> I also consider that it should go without saying, for citizens to
> co-manage the affairs of the state, in collaboration with the
> government. This is why I firmly believe in the open government
> philosophy.
>
> (Cottica, n.d.)

Open government also offers a space for bi-directional learning where
citizens learn the was a political institution operates while the
institution learn the way citizens (especially edgeryders) want to do
things. That the learning is bi-directional is something that O’Donoghue
stresses as a benefit of increaces youth participation:

> youth participation in decision making leads to changes in the
> organizational climate and a deeper commitment by adults to youth
> development principles.
>
> (O’Donoghue & Kirshner, 2002)

The benefit of youth participation should not only be considered as a
one-way approach where it is the life of the young that needs to be
influenced in a governmental fashion. Also the life of institutions is
in need of guidance and change, a transition even. Perhaps the most
impact will be in how youth participation changes the institutional
life, rather than how it changes the young. It can be beneficial to turn
the perspective on its head like this an instead assume that it is the
public institutions that should participate in all the activity that the
youth networks construct. As seen in the part on open data in the
section on Edgeryders in this paper, it is often on citizen initiatives
that open government projects begin which is later adapted by
institutions.

Herrera also stresses this point:

> What’s more, socialization processes are becoming more bidirectional
> with youth playing a more intensified role in teaching and socializing
> the older generation to adapt to new technology and cultural patterns
> associated with globalization.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

Youth participation forces institutions to become more democratic and
live up to their ideals. At least it becomes a pressure for this. This
can be seen in the protests around the ACTA treaty when it was protests
from the outside, with a majority of young participants that led to the
European parliament asserting pressure on the European commission to
release unredacted versions of the negotiated text.

### Users and citizens

The idea of user communities is also reflected in the experiences told
by *demsoc* in a mission report about the “We Live Here” project,
mapping civic networks in Brighton.

> People don’t think about “democracy”, they think about needs. Although
> people felt that there were issues that they wanted to raise with the
> council and with public services, the civic activists we spoke to were
> largely uninterested in “democracy” conceptually. They were interested
> in getting solutions to community needs, and expressing
> community voices - goals that actually would need to be delivered
> by democracy.
>
> (demsoc, n.d.)

The same sentiment is reflected in the fact that edgeryders in their
mission report talk about their and their communities needs, projects,
networks and issues, but their political participation is rarely if ever
framed in term of Europe and european youth. Political participation is
not approached from the perspective of being a citizen within an
abstract political entity such as a nation or Europe. One can however
find the European perspective as motivation from the part of the

#### Prototyping cultures

It is not possible to sketch a single path to how the gap between
edgeryders and institutions can be bridged. What is clear is that there
is a great opportunity in tapping in to the resources and creativity of
the kind of policy innovation, if we can call it that, that edgeryders
all over Europe are doing. This quote from the report on Spaghetti Open
Data highlights this:

> I think what is happening is this: the civil society is emerging as an
> allied of the innovators within the public sector. They can go to
> their bosses and say “look, these guys are hellbent on this stuff.
> Either we move fast or they will move first and leave us looking like
> idiots. The good news is, we can ask them to help us, and they will!
> So we can appropriate some political benefit releasing data, and
> everybody wins”.
>
> (Cottica, n.d.)

Civil society is prototyping the new society, but they still can’t do it
without institutional support. Or rather, the civil society version will
be a working prototype – good enough to make an impact but could be made
better with the right kind of support. Again from Spaghetti Open Data:

> I personally love that Spaghetti Open Data is created by civil society
> itself, is the best way this portal offers useful service to society.
> But also acknowledge that if the government gets involved much better,

New forms of political participation are adapted to uncertainty, chaotic
organization, experimentation and trial and error. This form of
participation is experimental in its character, examines different was
of doing things and questions the overarching goals. O’Donoghue echoes
this when she says:

> These organizations often do not face the same sets of constraints as
> public institutions, and as a result, they may offer young people the
> type of alternative spaces that they need to reflect critically and
> build capacity for action.
>
> (O’Donoghue & Kirshner, 2002)

By participating in youth-led initiatives rather than in formal
decision-making processes, young people learn not just how the world
works today and how the political process is structured today, but also
how it *could be* structured and they learn to critique the current
models for political participation. These self-organized initiatives
gives a learning experience on a really low level. A radical learning
experience in the precise sense of the word radical – to go to the root
of something.

Prototyping requires communities that can act together. “User
communities”, as Stengers talks about, who are linked not as citizens to
an abstract entity like the state, but linked to each other due to
material exchanges and dependencies, such as physical proximity of
neighbours, or common concerns for a specific set of issues.

’’Beckery’’ talks about this community building as a key characteristic
of Edgeryders:

> The focus on engaging local communities marks the second facet of
> Edgeryders’ activities that suggests, to me, that they are already
> working to build a resilient future
>
> (Beckery, n.d.)

A concrete example of a prototyping culture is the ’’Transition Towns’’
movement that James Beecher mentions in his mission report on practical
resilience(Beecher, n.d.) where he cites several ongoing projects such
as a farmers market, a car club and an edible gardens project.

Prototyping culture also has a performative element in it in the sense
that a prototypical form of social organization is presented and put on
display as a possibility. This is directly suggested as a method in a
mission report by James Hester suggesting that edgeryders make use of
“applied history methods” to enact future scenarios and ways of living.

> It could be a portrayal of a London flat living a 1-planet lifestyle,
> an off-grid and fully self-sufficient farm, or even an entire
> neighbourhood operating on an alternative currency. [...] We get a
> group together and come up with a scenario. We do the research on what

> come up with, we set up a place where we will portray that scenario,
> as accurately as possible, and invite people to come, see for
> themselves, and ask questions.
>
> (Hester, n.d.)

Aspects of this can be seen in several projects that edgeryders are
involved in – a sense that something made possible in a small scale or
for a short while gives a hint to a possible future model that can be
scaled up. Beckery mentions several in her post about
relilience(Beckery, n.d.) and writes:

The active engagement that participation is giving young people is a
training not only for participating but participating effectively in
ways that create change. I can only speak for myself in this matter. I
learned how to talk to the media and how to form horisontal networks
with my peers long before i learned how to participate in public
institutions, when I was engaged in the debate over file-sharing and
intellectual property. The thing that for me and many others was an eye
opener was the activism around the European telecoms package. This was
the first time my net activist generation engaged actively with the
decision making process of a political institution. People started
emailing and calling members of the parliament en masse to express their
view on what was considered unfair ammendments to the telecoms package.
Several people also went to Brussels to give their opinion on the
matter. This engagement has become even more intense with the anti-ACTA
activism that has been a collective learning experience for everyone
involved on the complicated policy process of the european commission;
on different committies and their functions, on ammendments and
rejections. I have to admit that personally I gave up about half-ways
into it and left it to others to continue to focus on ACTA with a tunnel
vision. Once people got engaged in it there was no way out and it felt
like the rabiit hole just went deeper and deeper. So much effort was
spent on this by so many people during so many sleepless nights that one
started to wonder if this really was the way it should be. What made the
experience more bitter was to see all the active attempts to circumvent
the democratic process by the advocates of the treaty. For all the
people that got a first hand learning experience of how to engage with
political institutions, there are as many people for whom it was the
first and last time.

An alternative to both top-down and bottom-up approaches is spelled out
in the report about Kyopol, which is described as follows: “Kyopol
promotes the development of”high quality" civic initiatives, by
providing tools, methodologies and teaching resources that promote a
participation which is transparent, informed, balanced, profound and
documented."

> Kyopol works, in short, as a decentralized and transparent “Facebook
> of civic engagement”, which would be regularly used by citizens and
> institutions of all kinds, to inform (/inform themselves) about civic
> initiatives taking place in the places they care for, and deal with
> subjects that matter to them.

They call what they do “from-the-middle-and-out”.

For substantial change and participation, there are problems with both
the top-down and bottom-up approaches. This relates to “the project
fallacy” as well as to previous failed attempts at youth political
participation initiatives.

Concluding Remarks
==================

Summary of analysis
-------------------

In this paper I have compared ideas and experiences of political
participation as it manifests on the Edgeryders platform with the
current perspectives on European youth policy. It has been shown that
there are significant differences between the two and that edgeryders
view and practice political participation as something more integrated
in their everyday lives and something more experimental that takes many
different forms. Youth policy tend to rely on a perspective where
participation equals participation in formal political processes, while
for edgeryders this is just one way of embarking on a collective process
to change the conditions of society.

Lessons learned

On changing relations between youth and institutions
----------------------------------------------------

The conclusion form these differences is that it is not simply a matter
of formulating a new youth policy, but what is needed is a
re-negotiation of the relation between youth and political institutions
when it comes to political participation. The traditional institutions
are unable to direct youth today. As Herrera says:

> Young people in the contemporary period acquire cultural and political
> dispositions through new avenues of participation. Adult authorities,
> including parents and teachers, and institutions such as schools and
> universities, while they retain a degree of authority, hold less sway
> over the socialization of young people than in even the recent past.
>
> (Herrera, 2006)

This shift in relations is not as simple as to say that governments
should move out of the way and let youth determine their own lives. This
perspective is strong in our contemporary society and is something
Foucault has called ’’governmentality’’(Foucault, Bertani, Fontana, &
Macey, 2004). This perspective, which has been translated as a critique
of youth policy by Besley(Besley, 2009) stresses on the one hand the
self-governance of youth and the entrepreneurial self that makes its own
future and on the other hand discourses of risk, security and control.

While globalization and neoliberal policies are reducing the impact of
public institutions in favor of market-driven ones, young people take
their own initiatives to make up for the losses and create participatory
alternatives. Perhaps this can lead to new kinds of common institutions.

A lot of this new ability to organize comes from making use of the
internet. Both directly as a tool and indirectly by being inspired by
some of the protocols that internet based participation has relied on,
such as coming from the free software movement.

> (Titley, 2008)

This precariousness must also be considered when looking at political
participation and we can see how current networked forms of
participation is already adapted to this by not having formal
hierarchical structures with one person filling one role, but more fluid
organizing that allows different levels of engagement and allows people
to move in and out of activity depending on how much effort they have
available in their current life situation. If people have to take (yet
more) jobs or suddenly get other engagements they can without
notification drop out of the activity and be replaced by someone else,
or have the organization transform to adapt to the loss of activity and
more the focus to other spaces.
